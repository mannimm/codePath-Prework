## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Here are some of my favorite apps along with their standout features:

Instagram: I love how smooth and intuitive the user interface is. It's also great that it works seamlessly across different platforms. The in-built video editor adds a creative touch to posts.

Snapchat: The disappearing messages feature is so unique and fun. I also enjoy playing around with the camera filters, and the ability to know where my friends are adds an interesting twist.

Spotify: What's cool about Spotify is that it makes connecting to my logged-in devices really easy. The personalized recommendations it offers based on my music taste are spot-on. I also enjoy checking out what my friends are listening to.

Apple Weather app: The AI-driven design of this app is truly beautiful. It provides accurate weather information for multiple locations, and the smooth animations make checking the weather surprisingly enjoyable. The weather alerts are a helpful touch.

Now, about the app I want to build, "Find-a-Terps":

Imagine an app tailored specifically for our University of Maryland community, where everyone can easily connect with fellow students. Aptly named "Find-a-Terps," this app functions as a campus dating platform that helps you discover potential partners who share your university journey. With a user-friendly interface, you can browse profiles, share photos and videos, and even engage in thoughtful conversations.



## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One of the highlights of the app is its recommendation engine, which takes into account your preferences and interests to suggest the best possible matches. This way, you can connect with someone who truly resonates with you. Whether you're looking for a study buddy or something more, "Find-a-Terps" aims to bring like-minded individuals together and foster meaningful connections within our university community.
